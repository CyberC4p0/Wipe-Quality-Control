# Wipe-Quality-Control

The Wipe Quality Control (AKA: WipeQC) tool assists in checking & screenshotting 7 different locations for hex values on a disk. Depending on your requirements, having all zeros or a signature at the bottom of the hex values of the disk is best.

This tool has been used right after using [WipeDrive](https://www.wipedrive.com/).
